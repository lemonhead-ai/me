# Profile Image Placeholder

To complete your portfolio layout, you'll need to add your profile image. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Add your profile image** to the `public` folder as `profile-image.jpg`
2. **Or update the image path** in the SVG to point to your actual image

The current setup includes:
- ✅ **Social media icons** (LinkedIn, Dribbble, GitHub) on the left
- ✅ **Custom blob shape** SVG mask matching your old portfolio
- ✅ **Text content** in the center with your name "Martin Mwai"
- ✅ **Scroll indicator** at the bottom
- ✅ **Responsive layout** that works on all devices

The blob shape will automatically use your primary color theme, and there's a fallback with your initials "MM" if no image is provided.
