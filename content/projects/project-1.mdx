## Overview

This e-commerce platform was built to provide a seamless shopping experience with modern web technologies. The application features real-time inventory updates, secure payment processing, and an intuitive admin dashboard.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Inventory**: Live stock updates using WebSockets
- **Secure Payments**: Stripe integration for safe transactions
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive management interface
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all devices
- **Search & Filters**: Advanced product discovery
- **Order Tracking**: Real-time order status updates

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with Next.js 14, leveraging the App Router for optimal performance. I implemented:

- Server-side rendering for SEO optimization
- Client-side state management with Zustand
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component

### Backend Services

The backend uses Next.js API routes with:

- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- JWT authentication
- Role-based access control
- Stripe webhook handlers for payment events

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Real-time Updates

**Problem**: Keeping inventory counts synchronized across multiple users.

**Solution**: Implemented WebSocket connections using Socket.io, with optimistic updates on the client and database transactions to prevent overselling.

### Challenge 2: Performance

**Problem**: Large product catalogs causing slow page loads.

**Solution**: Implemented pagination, lazy loading, and aggressive caching strategies. Used React Server Components to reduce client-side JavaScript.

## Results

- **Performance**: Lighthouse score of 95+
- **Conversion Rate**: 3.2% increase compared to previous solution
- **Load Time**: Average page load under 1.5 seconds
- **Mobile Traffic**: 60% of total traffic with excellent mobile experience
